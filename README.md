# Project: Mesto

## Description

This is my fourth project work. She gave me a start in learning java script.

In my project work, an application for adding pictures or photos is implemented. It's like instagram or tumblr. Images can be described and liked. The profile can be edited by entering your name and occupation.

The work was done according to the layout of figma.
