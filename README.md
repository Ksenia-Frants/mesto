# Project: Mesto

## Description

This is my third project work. She gave me a start in learning java script.

In my project work, an application for adding pictures or photos is implemented. It's like instagram or tumblr. The project is written in vanilla JavaScript. Images add with a title and description. You can add a card by pressing the Enter button while in one of the text fields. All forms are validated with JavaScript. The buttons are inactive if the fields do not pass validation. You can like your own and other people's cards. You can only delete your card by clicking on the trash icon. By clicking on the image in the card, you can open it in full-scale size. You can edit your profile by specifying your name and occupation, and you can change your profile photo by specifying a link to a new image. All popups with forms are closed by clicking on the cross, clicking on the background or on the Esc button.

The work was done according to the layout of figma.
